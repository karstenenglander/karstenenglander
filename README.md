Hey, I'm Karsten. 

I am a Software Engineer engaged in building robust systems and high-performance tools. My foundation is in systems programming and cybersecurity research, where I’ve engineered C++ image processing engines and privacy-preserving ML frameworks.

I extend these systems to the edge with native mobile development, specializing in building offline-first iOS applications using Swift, SwiftUI, and SwiftData.

Languages and Tools: C++, Python, Swift (SwiftUI, SwiftData), SQL, Java, React Native, Docker, Git, System Architecture & REST API Design, Machine Learning, NoSQL, CI/CD
